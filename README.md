## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- [Scroll into view method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView)

### Continued development

I will try to have a layout that manages the padding and spaces between sections.

### Useful resources

- [Why use rem instead of px](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSw6bPXZks) - This taught me
  a new best practice for responsive design.

- [Use of clamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erqRw3E-vn4&t=202s) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS clamp better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
